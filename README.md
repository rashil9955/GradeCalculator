# Grade Calculator 📊

A SwiftUI app designed to calculate GPAs for students using SDSU's (not san diego state univ) grading system, which excludes plus/minus grades. This project was born out of my personal need for an intuitive and reliable grade calculator during the fall semester of my sophomore year.

## 🌟 Why I Built This
While trying to calculate my grades, I found existing online tools either too complex or incompatible with SDSU's grading policy. Some required percentage inputs, while others relied on plus/minus grades that SDSU doesn’t use. I decided to build a tool that would work seamlessly for my needs—and perhaps help others too.

## 🚀 Features
- **Add Courses:** Input course name, credit hours, and grade.
- **Calculate Semester GPA:** Get an accurate GPA based on SDSU's grading system.
- **View Summaries:** Review GPAs for each semester and the overall GPA.
- **User-Friendly Design:** Intuitive interface built with SwiftUI.

## 📦 How to Use
1. Add semesters and courses by entering the course name, credit hours, and grade (A, B, C, D, F).
2. View the GPA for each semester.
3. Check the overall GPA for all semesters added.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Language:** Swift
- **Framework:** SwiftUI
